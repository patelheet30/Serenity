A rewrite of Serenity bot in Python. Serenity handles slowmode automatically for Discord servers by monitoring message activity and adjusting slowmode settings accordingly. However, it was designed by me initially for a private single server with no consideration for future growth or development. This project aims to rewrite Serenity with scalability, maintainability, and extensibility in mind, allowing it to continue supporting multiple servers effectively, while also providing a solid foundation for future features and improvements.

It uses hikari and hikari-arc for Discord API interactions, and aiosqlite for database management.

The rewrite is still in its early stages, and many features from the original Serenity bot are yet to be implemented. Therefore, no contributions are being accepted at this time.
